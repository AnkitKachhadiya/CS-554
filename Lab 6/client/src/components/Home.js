                    Pokémon are the creatures that inhabit the world of the
                    Pokémon games. They can be caught using Pokéballs and
                    trained by battling with other Pokémon. Each Pokémon belongs
                    to a specific species but may take on a variant which makes
                    it differ from other Pokémon of the same species, such as
